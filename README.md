# tidyMeasurements

## Introduction
The function <b>run_analysis.R</b> reads files of human activity from smartphones. 

The user is asked to download and extract the files in the URL in their working directory. The script can then be executed. It combines the relevant files to create two datasets (please refer to CodeBook.md for details). The second dataset is exported as a file to tidyMeasurements.txt in the working directory, containing the averages of means and standard deviations per user per activity.
